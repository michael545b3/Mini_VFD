# Mini VFD based on STM32

![Mini VFD](06_Pictures/Mini%20VFD.jpg)

This project is a compact Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) built around an  
STM32 microcontroller and an ST IPM (Intelligent Power Module).  
It is designed to control small AC motors efficiently and safely in a compact form factor.

## Software Status

The firmware is currently under development. As a hardware-focused developer,  
progress is steady but slow â€” writing robust embedded software takes time.

So far, the implemented functions run reliably, and more features are being added continuously.  
A demonstration video will be available soon.
